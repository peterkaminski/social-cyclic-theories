# Taxonomy Framework

[[README|← Back to Home]]

This framework provides the essential dimensions for categorizing and comparing different theories of social cyclicity. By using these axes, we can systematically classify various cyclic models and understand how they relate to one another.

## Key Dimensions for Classification

Before classifying cyclical theories, we need several axes/dimensions by which cycles differ:

| Dimension | What it captures | Possible values / range |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------------|
| **Time scale / period** | How long one full cycle takes | Years, decades, centuries, millennia |
| **Domain / subsystem** | Which part of society the cycle refers to | Politics, economy, culture, ideology, demographics, institutions |
| **Mechanism / driver** | What causes the cycle to repeat | Endogenous feedback (internal) vs exogenous shocks; structural pressures; reactions & counter-movements |
| **Shape / waveform** | The form of the cycle | Sinusoidal / smooth oscillation, punctuated (stasis + bursts), spiral / evolving cycle, nested/stacked cycles |
| **Determinism vs contingency** | How rigid the cycle is vs open to variation | Strict periodic, semi-regular, probabilistic, optional |
| **Scope of recurrence** | Whether it's local, civilizational, or global | Local (city, nation), civilizational, global systemic |

Using these dimensions, we can classify many known theories of social cycles and also identify gaps or potential hybrid types.

## Tree-Style Taxonomy

Here's a systematic tree-style classification of social cyclicity:

```
Social Cyclicity
├── By Time Scale
│   ├── Short (years to decades)
│   │   ├── Cultural cycles (fashion, style, art)
│   │   └── Institutional/ideational cycles (policy fashions, "business cycles")
│   ├── Medium (decades to century)
│   │   ├── Generational cycles / saecula
│   │   ├── Structural-demographic cycles
│   │   └── Political elite cycles
│   └── Long (centuries, civilizational)
│       └── Civilizational or rise/fall life-cycles
│
├── By Mechanism / Driver
│   ├── Endogenous (internal feedback)
│   │   ├── Elite overproduction / burnout
│   │   ├── Population pressure → crisis
│   │   └── Cultural backlash cycles
│   ├── Exogenous / external shocks
│   │   ├── Environmental disasters
│   │   ├── Technological disruptions
│   │   └── War, pandemics
│   └── Hybrid (internal susceptible, external triggers)
│
├── By Shape / Dynamics
│   ├── Smooth, rhythmic oscillation
│   ├── Spiral / evolving cycles (same pattern, shifting baseline)
│   ├── Punctuated / threshold-driven cycles
│   └── Nested / multi-scale cycles (small oscillations within larger ones)
│
├── By Scope / Domain
│   ├── Political / Institutional
│   ├── Cultural / Ideational
│   ├── Demographic / Social
│   ├── Economic
│   └── Socio-ecological
│
└── By Rigidity / Flexibility
    ├── Deterministic / near-regular
    ├── Probabilistic / fuzzy periodicity
    └── Open / contingent (cycle more a metaphor than fixed law)
```

## How to Use This Framework

You can pick a node or path in this taxonomy (e.g., *medium time scale → endogenous driver → structural-demographic cycles*) to locate a specific theory or model within the broader landscape of cyclical thinking.

### Example Classification: The Pendulum Model

Let's place the Pendulum model (Williams & Drew) into this taxonomy:

- **Time scale**: ~80 years (medium/multi-decadal to century scale)
- **Domain**: Culture, ideology, generational mood, institutional attitudes
- **Mechanism**: Endogenous feedback (society alternates between "We" and "Me" moods)
- **Shape**: Rhythmic/oscillatory (swinging pendulum)
- **Rigidity**: Semi-regular, somewhat deterministic, but with fuzzy boundaries
- **Scope**: Civilization-level (for Western/Anglo-American domain)

So Pendulum fits into: *Medium scale → Cultural/ideational cycles → Endogenous feedback → Rhythmic oscillation → Semi-rigid cycles*.

## Applications of the Framework

This dimensional analysis enables several analytical approaches:

1. **Comparative Analysis**: Compare theories across common dimensions
2. **Gap Identification**: Detect understudied combinations of characteristics
3. **Theory Selection**: Choose appropriate cyclical lens for specific phenomena
4. **Synthesis**: Combine multiple cycle models at different scales
