# Social Cyclic Theories Wiki

Welcome to a comprehensive taxonomy and analysis of **social cyclicity** â€” the various theories, scales, types, and dynamics of cyclical change in social systems. This wiki serves as a "map" for understanding how different cyclic or oscillatory models in history, sociology, political theory, and related fields relate to one another.

**About This Wiki**: This entire wiki was created using AI assistance, with prompts and curation by Peter Kaminski. ChatGPT 5 was used to create the initial [[Overview]] page, and Claude Code was used to flesh that out into the comprehensive wiki structure you see here. While AI tools are powerful, they can make mistakes - there may be errors, omissions, or misunderstandings in the content. Issue reports and pull requests are welcome at the [social-cyclic-theories repo](http://github.com/peterkaminski/social-cyclic-theories) or you can [email Pete](mailto:kaminski@istori.com).

## Core Framework

The foundation of our taxonomy rests on key dimensions that help classify and compare different cyclical theories:

- **[[Taxonomy Framework]]** - The essential dimensions for categorizing social cycles (time scale, mechanism, shape, scope, etc.)

## Major Families of Social Cyclic Theories

Each family represents a distinct approach to understanding cyclical change in social systems:

### Long-Term Civilizational Cycles
- **[[Classical Social Cycles]]** - Rise, peak, decline patterns in civilizations and empires (Spengler, Sorokin)
- **[[World-System Cycles]]** - Global hegemonic transitions and systemic cycles of accumulation (Wallerstein, Arrighi)

### Economic Cycles
- **[[Economic Cycles]]** - Kondratiev long waves, Kuznets infrastructure cycles, and Schumpeterian innovation patterns

### Medium-Term Social Cycles
- **[[Generational Cycles]]** - Strauss-Howe generational theory and the "four turnings" (~80-year cycles)
- **[[Structural-Demographic Cycles]]** - Population pressure, youth bulges, and state fiscal stress (Goldstone, Turchin)
- **[[Institutional Political Cycles]]** - Elite circulation and political regime changes (Pareto)
- **[[Schlesinger Political Cycles]]** - Liberal-conservative alternation in American politics

### Adaptive and Transitional Cycles
- **[[Adaptive Cycles]]** - Panarchy framework and multi-level social-ecological cycles
- **[[Punctuated Equilibrium]]** - Long stasis periods punctuated by rapid transitions
- **[[Social Tipping Cycles]]** - Critical thresholds and regime shifts in social systems

### Cultural and Shorter-Term Cycles
- **[[Cultural Style Cycles]]** - Fashion, art, and cultural signaling patterns
