Here is a proposed **taxonomy of social cyclicity** — a way to categorize different theories, scales, types, and dynamics of cyclical change in social systems. (You can think of this as a “map” for understanding how various cyclic or oscillatory models in history, sociology, political theory, etc. relate to one another.)

## I. Dimensions for Taxonomy

First, before classifying, we need a few axes/dimensions by which cycles differ. Some key parameters:

| Dimension                      | What it captures                              | Possible values / range                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Time scale / period**        | How long one full cycle takes                 | Years, decades, centuries, millennia                                                                          |
| **Domain / subsystem**         | Which part of society the cycle refers to     | Politics, economy, culture, ideology, demographics, institutions                                              |
| **Mechanism / driver**         | What causes the cycle to repeat               | Endogenous feedback (internal) vs exogenous shocks; structural pressures; reactions & counter-movements       |
| **Shape / waveform**           | The form of the cycle                         | Sinusoidal / smooth oscillation, punctuated (stasis + bursts), spiral / evolving cycle, nested/stacked cycles |
| **Determinism vs contingency** | How rigid the cycle is vs open to variation   | Strict periodic, semi-regular, probabilistic, optional                                                        |
| **Scope of recurrence**        | Whether it’s local, civilizational, or global | Local (city, nation), civilizational, global systemic                                                         |

Using these dimensions, we can classify many known theories of social cycles and also propose gaps or hybrid types.

## II. Major Families of Social Cyclic Theories

Here are broad families / classes of cyclic models of social change, aligned with the taxonomy axes above:

| Family                                                 | Time scale / period                       | Domain(s)                                    | Mechanism(s)                                                                 | Shape / pattern                                             | Examples & notes                                                                                                            |

## III. A Refined Taxonomy (Tree Form)

To better systematize, here’s a tree-style taxonomy (with examples) of social cyclicity:

```
Social Cyclicity
├── By Time Scale
│   ├── Short (years to decades)
│   │   ├── Cultural cycles (fashion, style, art)
│   │   └── Institutional/ideational cycles (policy fashions, “business cycles”)
│   ├── Medium (decades to century)
│   │   ├── Generational cycles / saecula
│   │   ├── Structural-demographic cycles
│   │   └── Political elite cycles
│   └── Long (centuries, civilizational)
│       └── Civilizational or rise/fall life-cycles
│
├── By Mechanism / Driver
│   ├── Endogenous (internal feedback)
│   │   ├── Elite overproduction / burnout
│   │   ├── Population pressure → crisis
│   │   └── Cultural backlash cycles
│   ├── Exogenous / external shocks
│   │   ├── Environmental disasters
│   │   ├── Technological disruptions
│   │   └── War, pandemics
│   └── Hybrid (internal susceptible, external triggers)
│
├── By Shape / Dynamics
│   ├── Smooth, rhythmic oscillation
│   ├── Spiral / evolving cycles (same pattern, shifting baseline)
│   ├── Punctuated / threshold-driven cycles
│   └── Nested / multi-scale cycles (small oscillations within larger ones)
│
├── By Scope / Domain
│   ├── Political / Institutional
│   ├── Cultural / Ideational
│   ├── Demographic / Social
│   ├── Economic
│   └── Socio-ecological
│
└── By Rigidity / Flexibility
    ├── Deterministic / near-regular
    ├── Probabilistic / fuzzy periodicity
    └── Open / contingent (cycle more a metaphor than fixed law)
```

You can pick a node or path in this taxonomy (e.g. *medium time scale → endogenous driver → structural-demographic cycles*) to locate a specific theory or model.

## IV. Applying the Taxonomy: “Pendulum” in This Map

Let’s place the Pendulum model (Williams & Drew) into this taxonomy:

* **Time scale**: ~80 years (so “medium / multi-decadal to century” scale)
* **Domain**: Culture, ideology, generational mood, institutional attitudes
* **Mechanism**: Endogenous feedback (society alternates between “We” and “Me” moods)
* **Shape**: Rhythmic / oscillatory (swinging pendulum)
* **Rigidity**: Semi-regular, somewhat deterministic, but with fuzzy boundaries
* **Scope**: Civilization-level (for Western / Anglo-American domain)

So Pendulum fits into the branch: *Medium scale → Cultural/ideational cycles → Endogenous feedback → Rhythmic oscillation → Semi-rigid cycles*.

## V. Strengths, Limitations & Use Cases of the Taxonomy

**Strengths:**

* Helps you see how different cycle theories relate or differ
* Enables you to compare and contrast models on common dimensions
* Helps detect gaps (e.g. combining demographic + cultural cycles)
* Useful in selecting which cyclical lens is suitable for a given phenomenon

**Limitations:**

* Real societies are messy; many dynamics are overlapping or non-cyclic
* Some cycles may only be loosely analogous (i.e. metaphorical)
* Hidden mechanisms or external shocks may modulate or distort cycles
* Some theories may straddle categories (hybrids) or defy clean classification

**Use Cases:**

* When someone proposes a new cyclical model (e.g. for politics, culture), you can situate it in this taxonomy
* When analyzing a phenomenon (say, rise of populism), you can test if it aligns with a demographic, generational, or cultural cycle
* When synthesizing multiple cycle models, you can align them on different scales (nested cycles)
